# Final Assingment of Machine Learning with Big Data course

This report constitutes the final assignment for the Machine Learning with Big Data course. It focuses on analyzing the FIFA 18 dataset. Four types of analysis are conducted: classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection. To perform these analyses, data preprocessing, including cleaning, noise handling, and normalization are performed. Then, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are employed, such as neural networks and k-means, for the analysis. In addition, other techniques are utilized to improve the accuracy of the analysis, including PCA for dimensionality reduction and the Elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters in K-means. The results were evaluated using various metrics such as F1-score, MSE, RMSE, and correlations.
